# Windows 60Hz automatic refresh rate switch on battery
I've set this as a function available in my Powershell using Powershell modules. 
The function is called from a task I made in task scheduler, of which you see the XML.
The function will switch the rate only if one monitor is currently being used, and sets the maximum available refresh rate for any computer you might be using.
